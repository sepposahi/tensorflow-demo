# tensorflow-demo

Project implemented while reading [
AI and Machine Learning for Coders](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-and-machine/9781492078180/) book. This is project is mostly based on examples in the book.

Project uses Python 3.12 although Tensorflow documentation promises compatibility only with Python up to 3.11. Project is not using `@inject` by `python-dependency-injector` because I just could not make it work. I was stumbling with something related to following issues:
 * [#632](https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector/issues/632)
 * [#672](https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector/issues/672)
